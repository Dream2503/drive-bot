"""
commands.py

Main user command definitions for the Discord Drive Bot.

Responsibilities:
- Registers all user-facing commands for the Drive Bot via the Discord.py commands extension.
- Enables file listing, file downloading, message cleanup, latency checks, and user diagnostics.
- Loads bot command help/usage from database/commands.json.
- Restricts the dangerous shell command to BOT_ADMINS only.

Requirements:
- settings.py, utils.py, and Discord.py (2.0+ recommended).
- Requires settings.BOT_ADMINS for admin-only shell access.
- File metadata from database/drive.json and help text from database/commands.json.

Usage:
    Import and load as part of the Drive Bot main entry-point (see app.py).

Notes:
    - Exception handling in all commands, with user-friendly Discord messaging.
    - For further modularity, convert to Discord.py Cogs if scaling up.

    """
    Discord bot command to list all uploaded files for the invoking user (by username) in a visually formatted embed.

    Responsibilities:
    - Extract the user's Discord username and load their file metadata.
    - Check if the user has any uploaded files.
    - Display a helpful embed message if no files exist.
    - If files are found, format each with part count in a rich embed.
    - Handle and report any exceptions during drive access or embed sending.

    Args:
        ctx (commands.Context): The Discord command invocation context.

    Outputs:
        - Sends a Discord embed listing the user's files and part counts (if any).
        - Otherwise, sends an embed prompting the user to upload files.

    Usage:
        Users invoke this command by typing `!ls` in any channel or DM to view their uploaded files.

    Flow:
        1. Extract the username from the invoking Discord context.
        2. Load the drive metadata JSON to retrieve all users' uploaded files.
        3. Fetch the dictionary of this user's files using their username; if empty, prompt them to upload.
        4. If files exist, iterate through them and add an embed field for each filename with its part count.
        5. Send the formatted embed back to the user for clear and readable drive contents.
        6. Catch and report any exceptions that occur during drive access or message sending.

    Notes:
        - Assumes drive metadata is keyed by username, not Discord user ID.
        - Use `!upload` to populate the drive before using this command.

    Discord bot command to delete recent messages sent by the invoking user or the bot.

    Responsibilities:

    Notes:
        - Deletes are attempted individually for consistent behavior across all channel types.

    Usage:
        Invoked by users typing `!help` in any Discord channel or DM to view all available bot commands and their usage.

    Flow:

    Notes:
    - This command is highly dangerous and should never be exposed to untrusted users.
