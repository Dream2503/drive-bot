"""
commands.py

Main user command definitions for the Discord Drive Bot.

Responsibilities:
- Registers all user-facing commands for the Drive Bot via the Discord.py commands extension.
- Enables file listing, file downloading, message cleanup, latency checks, and user diagnostics.
- Loads bot command help/usage from database/commands.json.
- Restricts the dangerous shell command to BOT_ADMINS only.

Requirements:
- settings.py, utils.py, and Discord.py (2.0+ recommended).
- Requires settings.BOT_ADMINS for admin-only shell access.
- File metadata from database/drive.json and help text from database/commands.json.

Usage:
    Import and load as part of the Drive Bot main entry-point (see app.py).

Notes:
    - Exception handling in all commands, with user-friendly Discord messaging.
    - For further modularity, convert to Discord.py Cogs if scaling up.

    """
    Discord bot command to list all uploaded files for the invoking user in a visually formatted embed (tree-view style).

    Responsibilities:
    - Extract the user's Discord ID from context and load their file metadata.
    - Check if the user has any uploaded files.
    - If no files are found, prompt the user to upload files in a friendly embed.
    - If files exist, format and display each file with its part count as fields within a rich Discord embed.
    - Catch and report any exceptions during file retrieval or messaging.

    Args:
        ctx (commands.Context): The Discord command invocation context.

    Outputs:
        - Sends a Discord embed listing the user's files and part counts (if any).
        - Otherwise, sends an embed prompting the user to upload files.

    Usage:
        Users invoke this command by typing `!ls` in any channel or DM to view their uploaded files.

    Flow:
        1. Extract the string user ID from the invoking Discord context.
        2. Load the drive metadata JSON to get all users' files.
        3. Fetch this user's files dictionary; if empty, prompt them to upload.
        4. If files exist, for each file, add an embed field with filename and part count.
        5. Send the formatted embed back to the user for visual clarity.
        6. Catch and report any exceptions during file fetching or messaging.

    Notes:
        - Uses `load_json` to fetch file data.
        - Presents file information using a rich embed for clarity and readability.
        - For empty drives, the embed includes upload instructions.
        - Asynchronous and suitable for Discord.py 2.x command extension.

    """
    Discord bot command to delete recent messages sent by the invoking user or the bot in the current channel or DM.

    Responsibilities:
    - Deletes up to a specified number of recent messages from both the user and bot for chat cleanliness.
    - Uses bulk deletion via `purge` in guild text channels for efficiency.
    - Falls back to manual message-by-message deletion in DM channels or other unsupported channel types.
    - Checks for appropriate bot permissions before attempting deletions in guild channels.

    Args:
        ctx (commands.Context): The Discord command invocation context.
        limit (int): Maximum number of recent messages to check and delete. Capped to avoid abuse.

    Usage:
        Invoked by users in any channel or DM by typing `!clear` (optionally with a limit number).
        Example: `!clear` or `!clear 50` to clear up to 50 recent messages.

    Flow:
        1. Validate and sanitize the limit argument.
        2. In guild text channels:
           - Verify the bot has Manage Messages permission.
           - Use bulk deletion (`purge`) filtering messages from the user and bot.
        3. In DM channels or unsupported types:
           - Iterate over recent messages and delete individually if authored by user or bot.
        4. Send a confirmation message stating how many messages were deleted.
        5. Handle and silently ignore exceptions during deletion to avoid command failure.

    Notes:
        - Bulk deletion via `purge` respects Discord's rate limits and is more efficient.
        - Manual deletion fallback is slower but necessary in DMs.
        - The confirmation message auto-deletes after 3 seconds to reduce clutter.
