transfer.py

Combined upload, download, and remove commands for the Discord Drive Bot.

Responsibilities:
- Handles uploading files from Google Drive links or a local upload directory to Discord,
  splitting large files into manageable chunks compliant with Discord limits,
  hashing and storing metadata per user.
- Handles downloading previously uploaded files by streaming chunked parts from Discord,
  reconstructing them into files saved locally in the download directory.
- Handles file removal (single, multiple, or all files), deleting all stored chunks from Discord
  and cleaning up user drive metadata.
- Provides progress feedback, error handling, and cleans up temporary files appropriately.

Requirements:
- settings.py (defines UPLOAD_PATH, DOWNLOAD_PATH, DRIVE path, FILE_DUMP channel)
- utils.py (provides Google Drive download, hashing, JSON operations, and chunk retrieval)
- Discord.py (v2.0+)
- Other dependencies: gdown, requests, pathlib.

Usage:
    Register this module with the bot instance.
    Invoke the `!upload`, `!download`, and `!remove` commands for file transfers and management.

Notes:
    - Only deletes locally downloaded files that the bot fetched for upload to avoid affecting user files.
    - Bot must have permissions to send, fetch, and manage messages in FILE_DUMP channel.
    - Chunk size for uploads is controlled by MAX_PART_SIZE.
    - Partial downloads and incomplete removals are handled safely with cleanup to avoid corrupted data.
    - Supports batch operations: upload, download, or remove multiple files at once, including 'all'.
    - Designed for sequential chunk operations but can be extended with concurrency for higher performance.

    Uploads a file chunk as an attachment to a designated Discord channel,
    computes its SHA-256 hash, and returns the mapping of hash to the Discord message ID.

    Responsibilities:
    - Ensure the upload channel (`FILE_DUMP`) is available for sending files.
    - Compute the SHA-256 hash of the given data chunk.
    - Write the chunk to disk temporarily if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.

    Usage:
        Called internally during file uploads to handle individual chunk uploads.
        The returned hash and message ID are used for metadata indexing and later retrieval.

    Flow:
        1. Check that `settings.FILE_DUMP` channel is set; raise error if not.
        2. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the chunk.
        3. Determine the file path for the chunk based on the hash.
        4. If the chunk file does not exist locally, write the bytes to disk.
        5. Open the chunk file and upload it as a Discord file attachment.
        6. Upon successful upload, delete the local chunk file.
        7. Return a dictionary with the hash as key and uploaded message ID as value.

    Notes:
    - Temporary files are stored and cleaned in the configured `UPLOAD_PATH`.
    - Uses Python 3.8+‚Äôs `unlink(missing_ok=True)` to safely delete files.

    Discord bot command to upload one or multiple files to a user's personal drive, supporting both local files and Google Drive links.

    Responsibilities:
    - Accept multiple upload inputs in one command, including Google Drive links and local filenames.
    - Support the special keyword 'all' to upload every file present in the local upload directory.
    - Download files from Google Drive when links are provided, handling link parsing and download errors.
    - Check for duplicates in the user's drive metadata and skip re-uploads.
    - Split large files into Discord-compliant chunk sizes and upload each chunk as a Discord message attachment.
    - Track progress with real-time status messages to the user during uploads.
    - Update persistent per-user metadata with hashes and Discord message IDs of uploaded chunks.
    - Clean up temporarily downloaded files while preserving user local files.
    - Provide a summary message indicating successful and failed upload attempts.

    Args:
        ctx (commands.Context): The Discord command context.
        paths (str): One or more Google Drive links or filenames to upload. 'all' indicates all local files.

    Usage:
        Invoked by users typing commands like:
        - `!upload <google_drive_link>`
        - `!upload <filename>`
        - `!upload file1 file2 ...`
        - `!upload all` to upload all files in the local upload folder.

    Flow:
        1. Extract the invoking user's Discord ID.
        2. Validate that at least one path or link is provided; else send usage instructions.
        3. If 'all' is specified, enumerate all files in the local upload directory to upload.
        4. For each input path or link:
           a. Determine if it refers to a local file or a Google Drive link.
           b. If local, prepare for upload; if a link, parse and download the file.
           c. Load user's drive metadata and skip files already uploaded, cleaning up temp files if applicable.
           d. Split files exceeding `MAX_PART_SIZE` into chunks.
           e. Upload each chunk while tracking hashes and Discord message IDs.
           f. Update status messages to indicate chunk upload progress.
           g. Save the metadata mapping for the uploaded file.
           h. Remove temporary files if downloaded.
        5. After processing all inputs, send a summary indicating which uploads succeeded or failed.

    Notes:
    - Utilizes utility functions for Google Drive downloading, SHA-256 hashing, and JSON metadata handling.
    - Assumes `settings.FILE_DUMP` is set correctly to the Discord channel for storage.
    - Respects Discord's attachment size limits enforced via `MAX_PART_SIZE`.
    - Provides robust error handling with user notifications and resource cleanup.
    - Designed for sequential processing; concurrency or parallel uploads can be added later as an enhancement.

    Discord bot command to download and reconstruct one or multiple files from the user's drive, streaming their contents into the local `download/` directory.

    Responsibilities:
    - Accept either a single filename, multiple filenames, or the 'all' keyword from the user as download targets.
    - Validate that each requested filename exists in the user's drive metadata (expand 'all' to all files).
    - Retrieve each chunk's Discord message by stored message ID and stream them sequentially for each file.
    - Write file chunks directly to disk in the download directory without loading entire files into memory.
    - Report per-file progress to the user, including success and error notifications.
    - Handle errors gracefully for each file, including deleting partially written files on failure.
    - Summarize the download results after completion.

    Args:
        ctx (commands.Context): The Discord command invocation context.
        filenames (str): One or more filenames to reconstruct and download, or 'all' to download all user files.

    Usage:
        - `!download <filename>` to download a single file.
        - `!download file1 file2 ...` to download multiple files in one command.
        - `!download all` to download all files from the user's drive.
        The bot saves each reconstructed file in the local `download/` folder.

    Flow:
        1. Parse user ID and load their file metadata from the drive.
        2. If 'all' is specified, expand to all available user's files; otherwise use provided filenames.
        3. For each filename:
            a. Validate existence in the user's drive. If missing, skip and notify.
            b. Prepare the output file path and create the download directory if needed.
            c. For each chunk:
                i. Retrieve the Discord message by message ID.
                ii. Verify the presence of a file attachment.
                iii. Read chunk data asynchronously and write it to disk.
                iv. After each chunk, update user with download progress.
                v. On error during chunk processing, clean up the partial file, notify, and skip to next file.
            d. Upon successful completion of all chunks, notify the user.
        4. After processing all files, send a summary reporting successful and failed downloads.

    Notes:
    - Output files are saved using specified filenames in the `download/` directory.
    - Partial files are deleted on error to avoid leaving corrupted files.
    - Requires bot permissions to fetch messages and download attachments in the configured `FILE_DUMP` channel.
    - Efficiently streams chunks to avoid high memory usage, supporting large files as well as batch downloads.

        - Update the drive metadata by removing each file entry.
