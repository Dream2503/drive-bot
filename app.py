"""
app.py

Main entry point for the Discord Drive Bot.

Responsibilities:
- Initializes and configures the Discord bot instance.
- Registers event handlers (such as on_ready).
- Ensures required directories and channels are accessible at startup.
- Loads command and feature modules to provide file upload, download, and management features.
- Handles bot authentication using the secret token file.

Requirements:
- Essential modules: settings, utils, commands, upload, download.
- Environment: 'database/bot_creds.txt' must contain your bot token.
- FILE_DUMP_ID (in settings) must refer to a real (and accessible) Discord text channel in your guild.
- All required permissions must be granted for full functionality.

Usage:
    python app.py

Notes:
    - For scaling or improved maintainability, consider splitting subcommands/features into Cogs.
    - The bot uses synchronous imports and startup logic; this is suitable for single-instance bots.
    - Error messages are output to the terminal for easier diagnosis.

    """
    Discord bot event handler triggered once when the bot successfully connects and is ready.

    Responsibilities:
        - Ensures required local directories exist for bot operations:
            - `UPLOAD_PATH` for user-uploaded files.
            - `DOWNLOAD_PATH` for reassembled downloads.
            - `TEMP_SPLIT_PATH` for temporary chunked files.
        - Fetches and caches the `FILE_DUMP` Discord channel object by ID for file chunk storage.
        - Logs startup details and diagnostic messages to both console and file.

    Usage:
        Automatically invoked by the Discord.py event loop upon bot startup.
        Sets up critical paths and validates the upload channel before the bot begins serving commands.

    Flow:
        1. Create the `upload/`, `download/`, and `temp/` directories if they donâ€™t already exist.
        2. Retrieve and cache the `FILE_DUMP` channel object using its ID.
        3. Log error messages if the channel is not accessible, suggesting permission/config issues.
        4. Log success messages if setup completes as expected, including bot and channel identity.

    Notes:
        - Requires `UPLOAD_PATH`, `DOWNLOAD_PATH`, and `TEMP_SPLIT_PATH` to be defined in `settings.py`.
        - Requires `FILE_DUMP_ID` to reference a valid `discord.TextChannel` where the bot has send/delete permissions.
        - These checks ensure all runtime paths are ready and prevent errors during uploads/downloads.
